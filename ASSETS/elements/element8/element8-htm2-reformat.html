  without the magnetic field in place:</td><td>Its output will be somewhat
  distorted.</td><td>It will quickly destroy itself from
  excessive current flow.</td><td>Its frequency will change slightly.</td><td>Nothing serious will happen.</td><td>8-47F1: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-47F2&nbsp; Targets displayed on the RADAR display
  are not on the same bearing as their visual bearing. What should you first
  suspect?</td><td>A bad reed relay in the antenna
  pedestal.</td><td>A sweep length misadjustment.</td><td>One phase of the yoke assembly is
  open.</td><td>Incorrect antenna position
  information.</td><td>8-47F2: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-47F3&nbsp; Loss of distant targets during and
  immediately after wet weather indicates:</td><td>A leak in waveguide or rotary joint.</td><td>High atmospheric absorption.</td><td>Dirt or soot on the rotary joint.</td><td>High humidity in the transmitter
  causing power supply loading.</td><td>8-47F3: A</td></tr><tr><td>8-47F4&nbsp; In a marine RADAR set, a high VSWR is
  indicated at the magnetron output. The waveguide and rotary joint appear to
  be functioning properly. What component may be malfunctioning?</td><td>The magnetron</td><td>The waveform generator</td><td>The STC circuit</td><td>The waveguide array termination</td><td>8-47F4: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-47F5&nbsp; On a vessel with two RADARs, one has a
  different range indication on a specific target than the other. How would you
  determine which RADAR is incorrect?</td><td>Check the sweep and timing circuits
  of both indicators for correct readings.</td><td>Triangulate target using the GPS and
  visual bearings.</td><td>Check antenna parallax.</td><td>Use the average of the two
  indications and adjust both for that amount.</td><td>8-47F5: A</td></tr><tr><td>8-47F6&nbsp; An increase in the deflection on the
  magnetron current meter could likely be caused by:</td><td>Insufficient pulse amplitude from
  the modulator.</td><td>Too high a B1 level on the
  magnetron.</td><td>A decrease of the magnetic field
  strength.</td><td>A lower duty cycle, as from 0.0003
  to 0.0002.</td><td>8-47F6: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F1&nbsp; A thick layer of rust and corrosion on
  the surface of the parabolic dish will have what effect?</td><td>No noticeable effect.</td><td>Scatter and absorption of RADAR

  for weak targets.</td><td>Slightly out of focus PPI scope.</td><td>8-48F1: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F2&nbsp; The echo box is used for:</td><td>Testing the wavelength of the
  incoming echo signal.</td><td>Testing and tuning of the RADAR unit
  by providing artificial targets.</td><td>Amplification of the echo signal.</td><td>Detection of the echo pulses.</td><td>8-48F2: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F3&nbsp; What should be done to the interior
  surface of a waveguide in order to minimize signal loss?</td><td>Fill it with nitrogen gas.</td><td>Paint it with nonconductive paint to
  prevent rust.</td><td>Keep it as clean as possible.</td><td>Fill it with a high-grade electrical
  oil.</td><td>8-48F3: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F4&nbsp; Which of the following is the most
  useful instrument for RADAR servicing?</td><td>Oscilloscope.</td><td>Frequency Counter.</td><td>R. F. Wattmeter.</td><td>Audio generator.</td><td>8-48F4: A</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F5&nbsp; A non-magnetic screwdriver should
  always be used when replacing what component?</td><td>TR tube.</td><td>Mixer.</td><td>Video amplifier.</td><td>Magnetron.</td><td>8-48F5: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-48F6&nbsp; What kind of display would indicate
  water in the waveguide?</td><td>Spoking.</td><td>Large circular rings near the
  center.</td><td>Loss of range rings.</td><td>Wider than normal targets.</td><td>8-48F6: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F1&nbsp; Why is coaxial cable often used for
  S-band installations instead of a waveguide?</td><td>Losses can be kept reasonable at
  S-band frequencies and the installation cost is lower.</td><td>A waveguide will not support the
  power density required for modern S-band RADAR transmitters.</td><td>S-band waveguide flanges show too
  much leakage and are unsafe for use near personnel.</td><td>Dimensions for S-band waveguide do
  not permit a rugged enough installation for use by ships at sea.</td><td>8-49F1: A</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F2&nbsp; RADAR interference to a communications
  receiver is eliminated by:</td><td>Not operating other devices when
  RADAR is in use.</td><td>Properly grounding, bonding, and
  shielding all units.</td><td>Using a high pass filter on the
  power line.</td><td>Using a link coupling.</td><td>8-49F2: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F3&nbsp; Why should long horizontal runs of
  waveguide be avoided?</td><td>They must be insulated to prevent
  electric shock.</td><td>To prevent damage from shipboard
  personnel.</td><td>To minimize reception of
  horizontally polarized returns.</td><td>To prevent accumulation of
  condensation.</td><td>8-49F3: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F4&nbsp; Long horizontal sections of waveguides
  are not desirable because:</td><td>Moisture can accumulate in the
  waveguide.</td><td>The waveguide can sag, causing loss
  of signal.</td><td>Excessive standing waves can occur.</td><td>The polarization of the signal might
  shift.</td><td>8-49F4: A</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F5&nbsp; In a RADAR system, waveguides should
  be installed:</td><td>Slightly bent for maximum gain.</td><td>As straight as possible to reduce
  distortion.</td><td>At 90 degree angles to improve
  resonance.</td><td>As long as possible for system
  flexibility.</td><td>8-49F5: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-49F6&nbsp; What is the most important factor to

  operation.</td><td>The antenna is in a location that is
  not shadowed by other structures.</td><td>Easy access for maintenance.</td><td>8-49F6: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F1&nbsp; Choose the most correct statement with
  respect to component damage from electrostatic discharge:</td><td>ESD damage occurs primarily in
  passive components which are easily identified and replaced.</td><td>ESD damage occurs primarily in
  active components which are easily identified and replaced.</td><td>The technician will feel a small
  static shock and recognize that ESD damage has occurred to the circuit.</td><td>ESD damage may cause immediate
  circuit failures, but may also cause failures much later at times when the
  RADAR set is critically needed.</td><td>8-50F1: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F2&nbsp; Before testing a RADAR transmitter, it
  would be a good idea to:</td><td>Make sure no one is on the deck.</td><td>Make sure the magnetron_s magnetic
  field is far away from the magnetron.</td><td>Make sure there are no explosives or
  flammable cargo being loaded.</td><td>Make sure the Coast Guard has been
  notified.</td><td>8-50F2: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F3&nbsp; While making repairs or adjustments to
  RADAR units:</td><td>Wear fire-retardant clothing.</td><td>Discharge all high-voltage
  capacitors to ground.</td><td>Maintain the filament voltage.</td><td>Reduce the magnetron voltage.</td><td>8-50F3: B</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F4&nbsp; While removing a CRT from its
  operating casing, it is a good idea to:</td><td>Discharge the first anode.</td><td>Test the second anode with your
  fingertip.</td><td>Wear gloves and goggles.</td><td>Set it down on a hard surface.</td><td>8-50F4: C</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F5&nbsp; If a CRT is dropped:</td><td>Most likely nothing will happen
  because they are built with durability in mind.</td><td>It might go out of calibration.</td><td>The phosphor might break loose.</td><td>It might implode, causing damage to
  workers and equipment.</td><td>8-50F5: D</td></tr><tr><td>8-50F6&nbsp; Prior to removing, servicing or making
  measurements on any solid state circuit boards from the RADAR set, the
  operator should ensure that:</td><td>The proper work surfaces and ESD
  grounding straps are in place to prevent damage to the boards from
  electrostatic discharge.</td><td>The waveguide is detached from the
  antenna to prevent radiation.</td><td>The magnetic field is present to
  prevent over-current damage or overheating from occurring in the magnetron.</td><td>Only non-conductive tools and
  devices are used.</td><td>8-50F6: A</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
